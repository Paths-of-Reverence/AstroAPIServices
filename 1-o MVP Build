Absolutely, focusing on the minimum viable product (MVP) is a prudent approach to get your **Astro API Automated Recordings** project off the ground. By concentrating on the core functionalities first, you can develop a working prototype that fulfills the main objectives and provides value early on.

### **Starting Point for the MVP**

To begin building your MVP, you should focus on implementing the essential functions that form the backbone of your application. Here's how you can approach this:

---

### **Step-by-Step Plan to Build the MVP**

#### **1. Set Up Your Development Environment**

- **Python Environment**:
  - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
  - Use a virtual environment (`venv` or `conda`) to manage your project dependencies.
  - Install necessary packages as you progress.

- **Project Structure**:
  - Create a basic file structure as previously discussed, focusing on the essential directories and files needed for the MVP.

#### **2. Implement the Airtable Webhook Receiver**

**Objective**: Create an endpoint that listens for webhook requests from Airtable upon form submission.

- **Choose a Web Framework**:
  - **Flask** or **FastAPI** are suitable choices for building a lightweight API.
  - For the MVP, Flask might be simpler due to its minimalistic nature.

- **Set Up the Webhook Endpoint**:
  - Create a Flask application with a route to handle POST requests from Airtable.

  ```python
  # app/main.py
  from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
  def receive_webhook():
      data = request.json
      # Process the data here
      return jsonify({'status': 'success'}), 200

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run(debug=True)
  ```

- **Test the Endpoint**:
  - Use tools like **Postman** or **curl** to send test POST requests to your endpoint and ensure it receives and processes data correctly.

#### **3. Develop Data Conversion Functions**

**Objective**: Convert the received data into formats suitable for querying the Swiss Ephemeris.

- **Date/Time to Julian Date Conversion**:

  - Implement a function to convert standard date and time into Julian dates.

  ```python
  # app/services/data_conversion.py
  from datetime import datetime
  import swisseph as swe

  def datetime_to_julian(date_str, time_str):
      dt = datetime.strptime(f"{date_str} {time_str}", '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
      julian_day = swe.julday(dt.year, dt.month, dt.day, dt.hour + dt.minute/60 + dt.second/3600)
      return julian_day
  ```

- **Location to Longitude/Latitude Conversion**:

  - Use a geocoding library like **GeoPy** to convert location names to coordinates.

  ```python
  # app/services/data_conversion.py (continued)
  from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim

  def location_to_coords(location_name):
      geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="astro_api")
      location = geolocator.geocode(location_name)
      if location:
          return location.latitude, location.longitude
      else:
          raise ValueError("Location not found")
  ```

- **Integrate Data Conversion in Webhook Receiver**:

  ```python
  # app/main.py (continued)
  from app.services.data_conversion import datetime_to_julian, location_to_coords

  @app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
  def receive_webhook():
      data = request.json
      date_str = data.get('date')
      time_str = data.get('time')
      location_name = data.get('location')
      julian_day = datetime_to_julian(date_str, time_str)
      lat, lon = location_to_coords(location_name)
      # Proceed to Swiss Ephemeris query
  ```

#### **4. Query the Swiss Ephemeris**

**Objective**: Obtain planetary positions for the given date, time, and location.

- **Set Up the Swiss Ephemeris**:

  - Install the **pyswisseph** library.

    ```bash
    pip install pyswisseph
    ```

  - **Implement the Query Function**:

    ```python
    # app/services/swiss_ephemeris_integration.py
    import swisseph as swe

    def get_planetary_positions(julian_day, lat, lon):
        swe.set_topo(lon, lat, 0)  # Set observer's position
        planets = [swe.SUN, swe.MOON, swe.MERCURY, swe.VENUS, swe.MARS,
                   swe.JUPITER, swe.SATURN, swe.URANUS, swe.NEPTUNE, swe.PLUTO]
        positions = {}
        for planet in planets:
            lon, lat, dist = swe.calc_ut(julian_day, planet)
            positions[swe.get_planet_name(planet)] = {
                'longitude': lon,
                'latitude': lat,
                'distance': dist
            }
        return positions
    ```

- **Integrate the Query in the Workflow**:

  ```python
  # app/main.py (continued)
  from app.services.swiss_ephemeris_integration import get_planetary_positions

  @app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
  def receive_webhook():
      # Previous code...
      positions = get_planetary_positions(julian_day, lat, lon)
      # Proceed to data conversion
  ```

#### **5. Convert Planetary Positions to Astrological Data**

**Objective**: Map the planetary positions to astrological signs and degrees.

- **Implement Conversion Functions**:

  ```python
  # app/services/astrological_calculations.py

  import swisseph as swe

  SIGNS = [
      'Aries', 'Taurus', 'Gemini', 'Cancer', 'Leo', 'Virgo',
      'Libra', 'Scorpio', 'Sagittarius', 'Capricorn', 'Aquarius', 'Pisces'
  ]

  def position_to_sign_degree(longitude):
      sign_index = int(longitude / 30)
      sign = SIGNS[sign_index]
      degree = longitude % 30
      return sign, degree

  def convert_positions_to_astrology(positions):
      astro_positions = {}
      for planet, pos in positions.items():
          lon = pos['longitude']
          sign, degree = position_to_sign_degree(lon)
          astro_positions[planet] = {
              'sign': sign,
              'degree': degree
          }
      return astro_positions
  ```

- **Integrate in Workflow**:

  ```python
  # app/main.py (continued)
  from app.services.astrological_calculations import convert_positions_to_astrology

  @app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
  def receive_webhook():
      # Previous code...
      astro_positions = convert_positions_to_astrology(positions)
      # Proceed to aspect calculations
  ```

#### **6. Implement Comparative Aspects Function**

**Objective**: Calculate aspects between the transit and natal charts.

- **For the MVP**, you can start by calculating aspects within the transit chart itself, or use predefined natal data for testing.

- **Implement Aspect Calculation**:

  ```python
  # app/services/aspect_calculations.py

  ASPECTS = {
      'Conjunction': 0,
      'Opposition': 180,
      'Trine': 120,
      'Square': 90,
      'Sextile': 60
  }

  ORB = 5  # Degree of allowable deviation

  def calculate_aspects(positions):
      aspects_found = []
      planets = list(positions.keys())
      for i in range(len(planets)):
          for j in range(i+1, len(planets)):
              planet1, planet2 = planets[i], planets[j]
              lon1 = positions[planet1]['longitude']
              lon2 = positions[planet2]['longitude']
              angle = abs(lon1 - lon2) % 360
              for aspect_name, aspect_angle in ASPECTS.items():
                  diff = abs(angle - aspect_angle)
                  if diff <= ORB or diff >= 360 - ORB:
                      aspects_found.append({
                          'planet1': planet1,
                          'planet2': planet2,
                          'aspect': aspect_name,
                          'orb': diff
                      })
      return aspects_found
  ```

- **Integrate in Workflow**:

  ```python
  # app/main.py (continued)
  from app.services.aspect_calculations import calculate_aspects

  @app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
  def receive_webhook():
      # Previous code...
      aspects = calculate_aspects(astro_positions)
      # Proceed to data formatting for Neo4j
  ```

#### **7. Prepare Data for Neo4j Submission**

**Objective**: Convert the astrological data and aspects into a format suitable for Neo4j.

- **Define the Data Model**:

  - For the MVP, you can keep it simple and represent charts, planets, signs, and aspects as nodes and relationships.

- **Implement Data Conversion**:

  ```python
  # app/services/neo4j_integration.py

  from neo4j import GraphDatabase

  class Neo4jHandler:
      def __init__(self, uri, user, password):
          self.driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(user, password))

      def close(self):
          self.driver.close()

      def save_chart(self, chart_id, astro_positions, aspects):
          with self.driver.session() as session:
              # Create chart node
              session.run("MERGE (c:Chart {id: $id})", id=chart_id)
              # Create planet nodes and relationships
              for planet, pos in astro_positions.items():
                  session.run("""
                      MERGE (p:Planet {name: $planet})
                      MERGE (s:Sign {name: $sign})
                      MERGE (c:Chart {id: $chart_id})
                      MERGE (c)-[:HAS_POSITION]->(p)
                      MERGE (p)-[:IN_SIGN {degree: $degree}]->(s)
                  """, planet=planet, sign=pos['sign'], degree=pos['degree'], chart_id=chart_id)
              # Create aspect relationships
              for aspect in aspects:
                  session.run("""
                      MATCH (p1:Planet {name: $planet1})
                      MATCH (p2:Planet {name: $planet2})
                      MERGE (p1)-[:ASPECT {type: $aspect, orb: $orb}]->(p2)
                  """, planet1=aspect['planet1'], planet2=aspect['planet2'],
                       aspect=aspect['aspect'], orb=aspect['orb'])
  ```

- **Integrate in Workflow**:

  ```python
  # app/main.py (continued)
  from app.services.neo4j_integration import Neo4jHandler

  @app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
  def receive_webhook():
      # Previous code...
      chart_id = data.get('chart_id') or generate_chart_id()
      neo4j_handler = Neo4jHandler(uri, user, password)
      neo4j_handler.save_chart(chart_id, astro_positions, aspects)
      neo4j_handler.close()
      # Proceed to respond to Airtable
  ```

- **Handle IDs and Session Management**:

  - Ensure you properly manage the database session and handle exceptions.

#### **8. Respond to Airtable Webhook**

**Objective**: Send a response back to Airtable to confirm receipt and provide any necessary data.

- **Construct Response**:

  - Airtable webhooks typically expect a simple acknowledgment.
  - If additional data needs to be sent back, format it accordingly.

  ```python
  # app/main.py (continued)

  @app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
  def receive_webhook():
      # Previous code...
      response_data = {'status': 'success', 'chart_id': chart_id}
      return jsonify(response_data), 200
  ```

#### **9. Testing and Validation**

- **Test Each Function Individually**:

  - Write unit tests for data conversion functions, Swiss Ephemeris queries, aspect calculations, and database integration.
  - Use Python's `unittest` framework or `pytest`.

- **Test the Entire Workflow**:

  - Simulate a webhook call with test data and verify that the entire process works as expected.
  - Ensure that the data is correctly stored in Neo4j.

#### **10. Error Handling and Logging**

- **Implement Error Handling**:

  - Add try-except blocks where necessary.
  - Ensure that exceptions are logged and do not cause the application to crash.

  ```python
  import logging

  logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

  @app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
  def receive_webhook():
      try:
          # Process data...
          return jsonify({'status': 'success'}), 200
      except Exception as e:
          logger.error(f"Error processing webhook: {e}")
          return jsonify({'status': 'error', 'message': str(e)}), 500
  ```

- **Configure Logging**:

  - Set up logging configurations to store logs to a file or display them in the console.

#### **11. Finalizing the MVP**

- **Ensure the Core Workflow Functions Correctly**:

  - From receiving the webhook to storing data in Neo4j, all steps should be operational.

- **Document Your Code**:

  - Add docstrings and comments to explain the functionality.

- **Prepare for Deployment**:

  - Create a `requirements.txt` file with all dependencies.
  - Set up environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., Neo4j credentials).

#### **12. (Optional) Send Email Notifications**

- **Implement Email Sending Functionality**:

  - Use libraries like `smtplib` or higher-level packages like `Flask-Mail` or `SendGrid`.

  ```python
  # app/services/email_service.py

  import smtplib
  from email.mime.text import MIMEText

  def send_reading_email(recipient_email, chart_id):
      msg = MIMEText(f"Your astrological reading is ready. Chart ID: {chart_id}")
      msg['Subject'] = 'Your Astrological Reading'
      msg['From'] = 'you@example.com'
      msg['To'] = recipient_email

      with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com', 587) as server:
          server.starttls()
          server.login('your_email@example.com', 'password')
          server.send_message(msg)
  ```

- **Integrate in Workflow**:

  ```python
  # app/main.py (continued)
  from app.services.email_service import send_reading_email

  @app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
  def receive_webhook():
      # Previous code...
      recipient_email = data.get('email')
      send_reading_email(recipient_email, chart_id)
      # Return response
  ```

- **Ensure Compliance with Email Sending Policies**:

  - When sending emails, make sure you're compliant with laws like CAN-SPAM and GDPR.
